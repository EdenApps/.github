## Hi there 👋

Welcome to Eden Apps. What will you grow?

We are embarking on a journey to build the next generation of business and data-driven applications. Drawing inspiration from prior open source projects, and innovating companies like 37signals, we are combining Open Source Software, with customer-first business practices to provide a platform for growing businesses of all types.

Our software is built ontop of Odoo 18, which we chose for:
- *PostgreSQL*: A DB platform that we prefer, with a great legacy of open source development, a robust set of core features, and a history of reliability.
- *OWL*: A UI framework modeled after React and Vue, with sensible features for the use cases it has been built for. For Eden, it is called Eden-UI.
- *Existing Apps*: A diverse set of open source applications that we can use to get started, giving us a hefty start, instead of building from scratch.

While we love the Odoo 18 open source stack, we think we can do the business side better. Our future business plans include the following:
- *Container-First*: Eden Apps will be container-first. Development will be done in DevContainers, and deployment will be on your choice of container infrastructure (K8S, Docker, Podman, etc).
- *Premium Apps*: Apps that most businesses don't need, but are available for those that do.
- *Supported Self-Hosted*: A one-time purchase for a supported, self-hosted system. Think of it like RedHat's downstream to Fedora's Upstream.
- *Cloud Hosting*: Shared and dedicated hosting environments, managed by us, updated by us. Pay monthly, and don't worry about your technology stack. (Coming soon).
- *Seamless Upgrades*: Odoo's recommended upgrade path includes providing the database back to Odoo for upgrades. This means someone at Odoo has access to your data. The Upgrade path for self-hosted environments will be as simple as upgrading the container image and running an upgrade script. NOTE: If you have custom code, you should do this in a staging environment first.

Our commercial side will also have a modern partner program, focused on the quality of our partners, instead of the quanity of our ecosystem. People who operate with the "Eden Partner" branding will be of high quality, capable, and have access to the resources they need to best serve our mutual customers. In the near future, we will be looking for input from the community on what they think a good partner program would look like.

## Repos
Our repos include the following:
- *Eden*: Our primary project. The entire open source project is in this repository.
- *Premium Apps*: A tracking repo for our premium apps. All design work will be done in the open, the codebase will be kept private unless you purchase something that includes the premium apps.
- *E-Spreadsheet*: a Fork of O-Spreadsheet, for Eden-UI.
- *Eden-UI*: A fork of OWL, modified for Eden.

Additional repositories will be built as needed, so there may be more repos than are here. These are the main ones.

## How to Contribute
Right now we are not accepting code level contributions. We are actively working on finalizing the fork, and making some initial modifications to resolve some little issues that we have with the forked code-base. We are also working on building container images to setup our baselines, and need to configure our GitHub actions and other processes for managing code contributions. Once we have all of that sorted out, we will happily welcome code contributions.

We are welcoming input on what things you would like to see in the Eden Apps platform, as well as the premium apps. If you want to see what apps we plan on building in the future, in no particular order, please check out the [Eden Apps Year One Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/EdenApps/projects/1) project.

If you have particular requests, feel free to open issues on our Eden repo, or Premium Apps repo.

Also, we have enabled discussion boards if you just want to chat with our team. For the time being, this will be the primary way we communicate with the community, through GitHub and it's tools.
